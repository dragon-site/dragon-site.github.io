                        <p>Gambling is one of the oldest pastimes in human history. The earliest recorded form of betting was in China in 2300BC. Since then gambling has grown dramatically and is now one of the largest growing revenues globally, with the global market projected to hit a staggering $500 billion in 2019. Macau has surpassed Las Vegas as the global gaming hub, generating $28 billion revenue in 2017.</p>
                        <p>The biggest issue that VIP gamers are currently facing is access to money and fees being charged by intermediaries. Many high-end gamers love to stake large amounts of cash but can be limited by their home country's stringent controls on the money.</p>
                        <p>With Dragon DRG, VIP gamers now have access to large amounts of their capital anywhere in the world instantaneously.</p>                        
                    </div>
                    <div id="text2">
                        <p>The act of remittance or payment has always been part of human society in some form of battering. The oldest known form of currency being used as trade was the stater coin by the Lydia Kingdom in 7th Century BC. As remittance has evolved over time to keep up with the ever-expanding global trade, it has grown in value to over $642 billion in 2018 with an annual growth of 5%.</p>
                        <p>With banks being the prime choice for transferring funds for B2C or B2B, a majority of everyday hard-working people and business owners have to pay multiple fees to transfer their funds. This can be include international transfer charges, currency conversions fees and even simply charging you for withdrawing money overseas. Some African banks charge 10% for international transfers.</p>
                        <p>Dragon helps people all around the world by transferring funds almost instantly, whilst cutting out intermediaries and helping to reduce global banking fees allowing the everyday users to have more control over their money.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="text3">
                        <p>E Gaming is one of the fastest-growing industries, with more and more people across the globe participating in gaming or watching live streams. With the global games market expected to hit $138 billion by 2018 it is fast becoming one of the latest and most lucrative entertainment industries, with mobile gaming making up $70 billion of the total value of the market.</p>
                        <p>Like all industries, remittance plays a big part in its growth, with central banks charging ludicrous fees and sometimes taking days to clear payments - the SWIFT payment system is not cut out for the average gamers needs.</p>
                        <p>With Dragon, gamers around the globe will have almost instant buying power at their finger tips, whether it’s to get the latest gear, purchase more lives or getting that new skin for their character, DRG will make this experience more user-friendly and cut the costs of intermediaries.</p>

                    <div id="text4">
                        <p>The wellness industry is one of the oldest forms of industries around the world with people always having an interest in beauty, health and personal care. In the last 20 years the industry has boomed massively with a global net worth of $4.2 trillion and an annual growth rate of around 6%.</p>
                        <p>With the Wellness industry, banks are taking huge fees in money transfers fees  for international payments of products. By introducing DRG into the ecosystem buyers and suppliers can reduce their transfer fees and obtain funds in less than an hour.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="text5">
                        <p>Art has been part of mankind since recorded history, with the oldest form of known art work discovered in two ancient quartzite caves in the Madhya Pradesh region of central India, dated 700,000BCE. As man has evolved so has art with paintings, sculptures, stained glass windows and drawings spanning the globe, becoming a source of shared wonder and gratification.</p>
                        <p>The art industry of today has boomed, with a global market value of $64 billion in 2017. With an annual increase of 10%, the art market shows it is on the rise, with nearly 500 million pieces of art being sold in 2017, financial intermediaries are taking their share of fees. With remittance playing such an important part of art culture, many art buyers are losing out as funds are frozen by banks or delayed by international payments while still having to pay high fees for the privilege of transferring money.</p>
                        <p>Dragon will dramatically reduce fees both the buyers and the auctioneers, speeding up payment times and making sure that the clients have access to their funds anywhere in the world when they need it.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="text6">
                        <p>The act of charity is a big part of what makes a society stick together, with  people from all walks of life donating money to the needy. This has caused a massive growth in the number of charitable organisations appearing around the globe to help the less fortunate.</p>
                        <p>Estimates suggest that $410 billion was raised for charitable causes in 2017, an annual increase of 5% from the previous year, however in many third world countries more than 20% of the money does not go to the people who need it. Common issues include such as money being frozen, poor planning and theft - not all donations go where they are needed.</p>
                        <p>Dragon aims to stop this by using the Dragon blockchain to account for every dollar donated, reducing fees charities have to pay whilst making sure the money is transferred in time to pay for food, raw materials and workers to help people in need.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="text7">
                        <p>Sports has always had a big part in civilised history, with wrestling being one of the first major competition sports of the Sumerian civilization in 3000BC and in ancient Egypt weightlifting, long jump, swimming, rowing, and archery.</p>
                        <p>As time has progressed, sports has evolved and been adopted globally with many international sporting competitions such as the Olympics, World Cup, Asian games and many others being a major driving force in many peoples lives. This need for competitive sports in day-to-day life has created a global sports market worth $600 billion which is growing every year.</p>
                        <p>With many transactions taking place throughout the entire industry from product purchases to paying salaries to international sponsorship deals, banks and middlemen take huge fees. With Dragon, we not only reduce the transaction fees but also give power back to the players and the companies who get charged hefty fees for contracts.</p>                            
                    </div>
                    <div id="text8">
                        <p>Education has always been a part of culture, with educational institutions dating back to Egypt in 3400BC. As civilisations grow, the need to educate the next generation is important for their continued growth. With the global education market expected to hit $10 billion by 2030, education is one of the biggest global markets there is - however some of its biggest challenges are remittance fees and access to capital.</p>
                        <p>Like all global markets access to funds is vital to the continued growth of schools, but with the banks taking huge fees (especially in Africa) and funds taking time to be transferred, education systems are hampered by slowness and cost inefficiencies of the banks.</p>
                        <p>Dragon will help the education systems by speeding up the transfer of funds, reducing the costs paid for each transfer - ultimately increasing the wealth of the financial institutions which will help further drive the educational system globally.</p>
