                                    itself with its roots tracing all the way back to 7th Century BC. 
                                    The act of remittance is thoroughly ingrained in our culture 
                                    and in today’s global workspace remittance systems have 
                                    evolved to maintain pace with the rapidly expanding global 
                                    trade market - which now has an expected growth of 5% 
                                    to reach of $642 billion with no sign of slowing down.

                                <p>
                                    E-Gaming is one of the fastest growing industries with an ever
                                    increasing number of people across the globe participating
                                    in gaming or watching live streams over the internet. With
                                    the global games market predicted to exceed a colossal
                                    $138 billion in 2019, it is rapidly evolving into one of the hottest 
                                    and most profitable entertainment industries. With the ever 
                                    present smart phone being carried around in people’s pockets, 
                                    casual gaming on mobile devices now accounts for
                                    a staggering $70 billion of the total market value.
                                    <br><br>
                                    Like all industries, remittance systems have played a significant 
                                    part in the growth of E-Gaming. However, banks continually 
                                    demand excessive fees despite offering slow processing 
                                    times of up to 3 days to clear payments. The standard SWIFT
                                    payment structures have simply not kept pace with this
                                    fast-paced industry and are undoubtedly no longer suitable 
                                    for the average gamers needs.
                                    <br><br>
                                    With Dragon, gamers around the globe will have virtually instant

                                    or in game purchases like providing their character with new

                                    Combat sports such as wrestling and boxing are totally
                                    embedded within our global culture, so it’s no surprise that
                                    many styles of combat have emerged over the years giving 
                                    rise to the evolution of mixed martial arts. Successful fighters

                                    everything from budget outlets, to high quality 7 star resorts
                                    with the global travel and tourism industry accounting for 10%
                                    of all jobs worldwide and as a percentage of global GDP at 10.4%.
                                    It is estimated that there are 700, 000 hotels and resorts

                    <p>
                        The money transfer industry is as old as the banking industry
                        itself with its roots tracing all the way back to 7th Century BC. 
                        The act of remittance is thoroughly ingrained in our culture 
                        and in today’s global workspace remittance systems have 
                        evolved to maintain pace with the rapidly expanding global 
                        trade market - which now has an expected growth of 5% 
                        to reach of $642 billion with no sign of slowing down.
                        <br><br>
                        While out-dated businesses focus on past issues, Dragon
                        is solely focused on the here and now by harnessing on and off

                        reduction in fees and are able to pass those savings on to the
                        customer or invest them back into growing their own business. 
                        Dragon is striving for a win win, value-add in every engagement 
                        and believe in giving the power back to people and businesses,

                <p>
                    E-Gaming is one of the fastest growing industries with an ever
                    increasing number of people across the globe participating
                    in gaming or watching live streams over the internet. With
                    the global games market predicted to exceed a colossal
                    $138 billion in 2019, it is rapidly evolving into one of the hottest 
                    and most profitable entertainment industries. With the ever 
                    present smart phone being carried around in people’s pockets, 
                    casual gaming on mobile devices now accounts for
                    a staggering $70 billion of the total market value.
                    <br><br>
                    Like all industries, remittance systems have played a significant 
                    part in the growth of E-Gaming. However, banks continually 
                    demand excessive fees despite offering slow processing 
                    times of up to 3 days to clear payments. The standard SWIFT
                    payment structures have simply not kept pace with this
                    fast-paced industry and are undoubtedly no longer suitable 
                    for the average gamers needs.
                    <br><br>
                    With Dragon, gamers around the globe will have virtually instant
                    purchasing power at their fingertips. Whether it’s access
                    to E-Gaming events, to getting hold of the latest merchandise, 
                    or in game purchases like providing their character with new 
                    skins. Dragon Coin, the world’s number one entertainment coin,

                    many styles of combat have emerged over the years giving 
                    rise to the evolution of mixed martial arts. Successful fighters
                    involved in this fusion of eclectic martial styles quickly gain
                    immense fame and success across the globe, drawing sizable 
                    crowds and enticing many people to take up the sport. Large
                    corporations such as UFC and ONE Championship have absolute
                    dominance over their rivals, with such gigantic growth UFC alone
                    has generated an impressive market value of $7 billion.

                <h5>DRAGON’S VIP GAMING REACH</h5>
                <p>
                    Gaming has been one of the oldest forms of entertainment
                    and bartering in human history, with gaming taken up as
                    a thrilling pastime across the planet. Since its beginnings
                    in 2300BC, the gaming market has exploded into life and has 
                    grown dramatically, boasting one of the largest-growing
                    global revenues with expected revenues reaching $500 billion
                    in 2019, with Macau alone surpassing the gambling mecca 
                    of Las Vegas when it generated $28 billion in 2017.
                    <br><br>
                    With a growing number of high-rollers across Asia looking to 
                    travel and test their luck in various casinos and VIP rooms across
                    the region, the challenges faced are with the movement of 
                    High Net Worth funds, inefficiency in the current system along 
                    with high fees both from traditional slow-paced banking
                    or the agent system.

                <h5>DRAGON’S HOSPITALITY REACH</h5>
                <p>
                    In the 21st century, hotel innovation continues to grow, offering
                    everything from budget outlets, to high quality 7 star resorts
                    with the global travel and tourism industry accounting for 10%
                    of all jobs worldwide and as a percentage of global GDP at 10.4%.
                    It is estimated that there are 700, 000 hotels and resorts 
                    worldwide making up part of a $7.6 trillion industry with the total
                    retail value of the global hotel industry set to cross $500 billion
                    in 2019.
                    <br><br>
                    Dragon coin, the world’s number one entertainment coin, is set

                    glamorous casinos, convention centres, vibrant entertainment
                    shows, thrilling theme parks, luxury retail outlets, award-winning
                    fine dining not to mention for purchasing visually stunning art
                    work and executive transportation.
                    <br><br>
                    A common pain point is the need to use a variety of systems
                    to operate effectively which have arguably put up obstacles
                    to innovation in the hospitality industry. Dragon have had
                    the visIon and foresight to recognise this and have broken
                    through the barriers of the outdated centralised
                    and inaccessible mishmash of services, stream line business
                    practices processes through innovation allowing more
                    attention to be on the consumers experience.

                    Dragon are evolving the hospitality industry and continue
